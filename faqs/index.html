    <div id="question">What can a Double do for me?</div>
    <div id="answer">
      We strive to get shit done for you and your team. Throw us anything and if we figure we couldn't complete it ourselves, we'll research alternatives and project manage the execution for you.
    </div>
    <br>

    <div id="question">What is Double's working hours?</div>
    <div id="answer">
      During the pilot period, we will be online from 10am-6pm Mon-Fri at your time zone. We are working towards around-the-clock availability.
    </div>
    <br>

    <div id="question">Wait! How could one Double be working around the clock?</div>
    <div id="answer">
      We will eventually have more than one Double serving you. Our system enables any Double to pick up where it was left off. <a href="mailto:david@askdouble.com">David</a> is created as an email alias allowing you to easily include your Double in your external conversations.
    </div>
    <br>

    <div id="question">How much is it going to cost me?</div>
    <div id="answer">
      We are still figuring it out but as a pilot customer, you will for sure enjoy deep discount when we launch. Meanwhile, weâ€™d love to hear your thoughts on pricing.
