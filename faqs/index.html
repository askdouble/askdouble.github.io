    <div id="question">What can a Double do for me?</div>
    <div id="answer">
      Double is your personal assistant, your business assistant, and most importantly, your problem solver. While you interact with Double the same way you work with a dedicated assistant, we built Double with capabilities that are way beyond any single person can provide.
      Throw us anything.  If we can't execute your request alone, we will research and suggest alternatives, which sometimes include sourcing help from a 3rd party and project manage the execution for you.
    </div>
    <br>

    <div id="question">What is Double's working hours?</div>
    <div id="answer">
    	We will be online from 9a.m.-6p.m. Mon-Fri at your time zone. We are currently serving the Beijing Standard Time Zone (UTC+8) from Hong Kong.  We are working towards around-the-clock availability and local presence on other major cities.
    </div>
    <br>

    <div id="question">Wait! How could one Double be working around the clock?</div>
    <div id="answer">
      While your Double communicates with you like an individual on Email, SMS, Slack, or via other popular communication channels, your Double is actually consisted of a network of Doubles.  Our system enables any Double to pick up where it was left off.
    </div>
    <br>

    <div id="question">How much is it going to cost me?</div>
    <div id="answer">
    	Our on-demand rate is HK$6 a minute payable weekly. Communicating with us is always free and we only count the time we work on your tasks, down to the second.
